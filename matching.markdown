<p class="Caption">Why do this?</p>

<p class="mb2 pb2">Many companies are working hard just to stay profitable in this turned economy. That makes it particularly difficult to say “yes” to charitable organizations which rely on them for financial support. The old model of non-profit organizations (NPO) relying solely on for-profit donations is a little bit like a two legged stool: with the support of a third party through donor-aided matching, we believe the stool can be stabilized.</p>


<p class="Caption">What is Donor-aided matching?</p>

<p class="mb2 pb2">Donor-aided matching is the process of getting three parties together to make a donation. Traditionally, there are two parties: the non-profit organization (NPO), and the for-profit company which provides the goods and services. We have introduced the concept of donor-aided matching because it is easier to support the weight of the philanthropic needs of a city with three entities than with just two. In the old model, an NPO asked a company to give a straight donation of goods or services, often for an auction or other fund-raiser. In the new model, the NPO will rally its own supporters to put up half the amount, with the promise that the donor company will give a matching half.</p>

<p class="Caption">How will it work?</p>

<p class="mb2 pb2">Let’s say we are approached by an NPO that has a mission to help education. We’ll send them a letter explaining that we’d have to say “no” to their request – unless they can find a matching donor. They then find a donor interested in joining the NPO and Canlis as the third leg of the stool. That donor gives $100 to the NPO, which sends it to Canlis to purchase a gift certificate. We then double the face value of the purchase and send the NPO a $200 gift certificate. Our pledge is to do this for any charitable 501c3 in the city, for any amount up to $5000, and up to a total match of $500,000 over the next several years.</p>
