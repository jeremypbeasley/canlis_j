section1_body: That’s pretty much it. Sometimes all it takes is a real invitation,
  and our family would really like you to come over for dinner. The opportunity to
  meet and serve you is one we don’t take lightly. Not for the past three generations
  at least. Come spend an evening. Our favorite thing in the world is taking care
  of others, and few places can do it quite like Canlis.
