<p class="Caption mb2">How to play</p>

1.) Tune in on April 17th at 8:30PM for two live-hosted rounds.

2.) Random numbers are drawn and whoever completed a bingo pattern first, wins the prize. A winning bingo pattern is a line with five numbers in a diagonal, horizontal, or vertical row. Numbers must be X'd out with a pen.

3.) Text us a photo of your winning bingo card (and the Canlis Family Meal stamp on the back) as fast as you can. <span class="ShowDesktop">(408) 702-1978</span>.
