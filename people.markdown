  bio: |-
    The second of three sons, Mark grew up in a restaurant family. He joined Canlis in 2003, after graduating from Cornell University and serving as a Captain in Air Force Special Operations. He met his wife, Anne Marie, while opening famed restaurateur Danny Meyer’s fifth restaurant, Blue Smoke, in Manhattan. Returning to Seattle, Mark spearheaded the generational transfer and brand modernization that has garnered the family business national acclaim as one of the finest restaurants in America. He now owns and operates Canlis restaurant with his more talented brother, Brian (who edits this website).

    He and Anne Marie reside on Queen Anne with their three children.

  name: Brian Canlis
  title: Owner

  bio: |-
    In his spare time, (and often at work) Brian enjoys photography, and serves as the company’s official photographer. He married photographer in 2015 and isn’t nearly as talented as she, but she loves him anyway.
    Brian Canlis returned home to Seattle in 2005 after 12 years of studying and working abroad. For college he spent time in England, Austria, and Spain before finishing a hotel sciences degree at Cornell University. Commissioned as an Air Force officer in 2001, he led Elmendorf Air Force base in winning the coveted Hennessy Award (for the Air Force’s best food and dining experience). Just prior to his promotion to Captain, Brian was transferred to Washington D.C. to help lead a protocol team that played host to world leaders and international heads of state. (There’s a good chance you saw him saluting the President on CNN.) Brian is also an accomplished photographer, a role he plays both for Canlis and in his spare time. He is married to fellow photographer [Mackenzie Canlis](http://www.mackenziecanlis.com/) and isn’t nearly as talented as she is, but she loves him anyway.

  title: Executive Chef

  bio: |-
    Born in Southern California and raised throughout different parts of the country, Brady fell in love with hockey at a young age. At the age of fifteen he moved away from home to pursue a promising professional career in the sport. After an injury ended his playing days, he moved home and started his first job – working at his grandparent’s neighborhood diner.

    In 2012, he was selected as the Chef de Cuisine at FT33 in Dallas, opening the restaurant under chef Matt McCallister and garnering numerous local and national awards. He then moved to Brooklyn, where he worked under chef Carlo Mirarchi as the Executive Sous Chef at Roberta’s and the two-Michelin-starred Blanca. In 2015, Brady joined Canlis as its sixth ever Executive Chef. Two years later he was recognized by the James Beard Foundation as one of the country’s five hottest rising star chefs.

  bio: |-
    A native of Colorado, Kyle moved to Germany as a Rotary International exchange student at the age of 16 before attaining degrees in Economics and International Relations at Seattle Pacific University. His first professional move took him to India, working in micro finance. In 2010 Kyle joined the team at Canlis as a newcomer to the industry. Within four years, and having worked every position in the dining room, he became the youngest Service Director in the restaurant’s history. And why not? He’s succeeded in creating the warmest hospitality experience in fine dining—a task he hardly considers to be work at all.

    in Canlis' history, rising from server assistant, to server, to assistant sommelier,
    to wine director in only four years. We weren't the only ones to notice - Food
    and Wine Magazine featured Nelson in their June 2005 profile of national up-and-coming
    sommeliers. The following year, Wine & Spirits Magazine named Nelson one of the
    "Best New Sommeliers" of 2006, and in 2008 he was recognized as Seattle's "Best
    Sommelier" by Seattle Magazine. After earning a culinary degree from Kapiolani
    Community College through the University of Hawaii, Nelson served at the prestigious
    Alan Wong's restaurant in Hawaii for three years. He found Canlis in the summer
    of 2002 and within the year.

    the mountains and water. In her spare time, she enjoys hiking, theater, and vegetarian
    cooking.
