<div class="Divider mb4 mt5 op30"></div>

<h2 class="Caption mt2 mb3">Menu</h2>

Changes daily. See the menu <a href="/nextweek">here</a>.

<h2 class="Caption mt2 mb3">No Contact Delivery</h2>

Our team will drop off your order at your door and send a text once it has arrived. Please note that we do need to see ID if you have purchased alcohol. If you live in an apartment building, we ask that you come outside to pick up your order. For everyone's safety, drivers will not enter buildings.

<h2 class="Caption mt2 mb3">Delivery Window</h2>

All orders must be placed by 8PM the day before your delivery.

Canlis servers aim to arrive within a 1 hour window of the time you have chosen. If you select 4pm, we will deliver your dinner between 4pm and 5pm. If you select 5pm, we will deliver between 5pm and 6pm. If you select 6pm, we will deliver between 6pm and 7pm. If you select 7pm, we will deliver between 7pm and 8pm. Weâ€™ll send you a text as soon as we are en route.

<h2 class="Caption mt2 mb3">Delivery Zone</h2>

Available to any address inside Seattle city limits. Unfortunately, we cannot deliver to West Seattle, due to the bridge closure. If your address falls outside of this zone, you are welcome to pick up your order at the restaurant. Please note that information in the delivery notes.

<h2 class="Caption mt2 mb3">Wine</h2>

Our sommeliers have paired several bottles for purchase with each meal. If you prefer to order directly from the Canlis wine cellar, email your name and phone number to <a href="mailto:wine@canlis.com?subject=Wine%20Delivery&body=Name:%20%3A%0D%0APhone Number:%20%3A">
wine@canlis.com</a>. Our sommeliers will be in touch with you shortly. Download our wine list <a target="_blank" href="/uploads/winelist.pdf">here</a>.

<h2 class="Caption mt3 mb3">Modifications</h2>

Unfortunately we cannot accommodate any food modifications for our Family Meal orders. This also includes splitting orders. 

<h2 class="Caption mt2 mb3">Cancellation Policy</h2>

If you need to cancel your order, you must do so 48 hours before your delivery time for a full refund. Cancellations under 48 hours will forfeit the full cost of the meal. Orders placed outside of city limits are still subject to the cancellation policy. Please note that all delivered goods are final sale.
