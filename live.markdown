Canlis will not air Friday Night Bingo this week. Instead a time of fundraising and civic self-reflection with <a href="https://www.symlmusic.com/">SYML</a> as he performs live Friday from 8-9PM PST.

An anti-racism benefit and time of self-reflection, we invite you to join us in supporting two organizations we deeply believe in: <a href="https://www.mentoringisamust.org/">M.U.S.T</a> and <a href="https://eji.org/">Equal Justice Initiative</a>. Canlis will match all funds donated during the hour-long program up to $10,000.

These difficult times shall pass, but if we have anything to do with it, not until our hearts have changed and our actions cement a new way forward.

We hope youâ€™ll join us here.

<h2 class="Caption mt3 mb3">Equal Justice Initiative</h2>

The Equal Justice Initiative is a non-profit organization, based in Montgomery, Alabama, that provides legal representation to prisoners who may have been wrongly convicted of crimes, poor prisoners without effective representation, and others who may have been denied a fair trial. It guarantees the defense of anyone in Alabama in a death penalty case. More information at <a href="https://eji.org/" target="_blank">eji.org</a>.
