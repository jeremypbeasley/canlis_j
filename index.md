section1_label: That’s pretty much it.
section1_body: Sometimes all it takes is a real invitation, and our family would really
  like you to come over for dinner. The opportunity to meet and serve you is one we
  don’t take lightly. Not for the past three generations at least. Come spend an evening.
  Our favorite thing in the world is taking care of others, and few places can do
  it quite like Canlis.
