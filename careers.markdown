  title: Working at Canlis
  desc: |-
    We’re honored you are interested in joining our team. To help that process, we recommend you read most of this entire website to figure out what makes us tick. We recommend thinking about how working here will help you become more of who you want to become, not what you want to become. We recommend taking the advice of your mother — whatever it was she said, try to remember — it’s going to help you get a job here.

    To enquire about current employment opportunities, please email Anthea Gundersen at [work@canlis.com](mailto:work@canlis.com).

  title: Philosophy matters
  desc: The only way we can continue to develop the Canlis experience in a way that
    fits with our mission and values is to invest in our people. We hire learners
    and we are learners ourselves. Canlis is a place where employees are nurtured
    and grown. Only then can they truly serve. Additionally, there is a particular
    humility inherent in learning. We want you to have this...or at least to desperately
    want to have this. It is a requirement for employment.

    major holidays...oh, and we'll never serve brunch.
