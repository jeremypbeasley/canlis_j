<p>Announcing KENLIS: Nothing big, just a giant blowout dance party at the Canlis dream house. Live music! Pink drinks! Roller skating! Horses!</p>

<p>A two-night party, August 9th or 10th, 7pm-12am, 21+ only. $270 includes all the food, drink, and dancing you could hope for. Get all dolled up, pink goes with everything! Tickets on sale Monday at 2pm at canlis.com.</p>

<p>This party (and other fun efforts this month) will benefit breast cancer research and patient care at Fred Hutch Cancer Center and Susan G Komen - a dear cause to our family and staff.</p>

<p>This whole crazy idea is made possible by the generosity of OpenTable and San Pellegrino. Thank you!</p>
<p>$345 per ticket</p>
