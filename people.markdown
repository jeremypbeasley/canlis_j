- name: Mark Canlis
  title: Owner
  bio: "The second of three sons, Mark grew up in a restaurant family. When he officially
    joined Canlis in 2003, he had already graduated from Cornell University, served
    as a Captain in Air Force Special Operations, and worked in nearly a dozen restaurants
    across the country. He met his wife, Anne Marie, while working for famed restaurateur
    Danny Meyer in opening Danny’s fifth restaurant, Blue Smoke, in Manhattan. Returning
    to Seattle, Mark spearheaded the effort towards generational transfer and brand
    modernization that has garnered the family business national acclaim as one of
    the finest restaurants in America.  He now owns and operates Canlis restaurant
    with his brother, Brian.\n \nHe and Anne Marie reside on Queen Anne with their
    three children."

- name: Brian Canlis
  title: Owner
  bio: |-
    Brian Canlis returned to Seattle in 2005 after 12 years of studying and working abroad. His college education saw him in England, Austria, and Spain before finishing a hotel sciences degree at Cornell University. Commissioned as an Air Force officer in 2001, he led Elmendorf Air Force base in winning the coveted Hennessy Award for the Air Force’s best food and dining experience. Just prior to his promotion to Captain, Brian was transferred to the nation’s capital to help lead an elite protocol squad that played host to world leaders and international heads of state. (There’s a good chance you’ve seen him saluting the President on CNN.)

    Lured back to the restaurant by a desire to join the family business, Brian joined his brother Mark in leading the company. While Mark is the leader of staff, guest and community relations, Brian focuses more on business development, product reinvention, and future opportunities. Together, they make a dynamic team who are just as great at being business partners as they are at being brothers.

    In his spare time, (and often at work) Brian enjoys photography, and serves as the company’s official photographer. He married photographer [Mackenzie](http://www.mackenziecanlis.com/) in 2015 and isn’t nearly as talented as she, but she loves him anyway.

- name: Brady Williams
  title: Executive Chef
  bio: |-
    Born in Southern California and raised throughout different parts of the country, Brady fell in love with hockey at a young age. At the age of fifteen he moved away from home to pursue a promising professional career in the sport. After an injury ended his playing days, he moved home and started his first job – working at his grandparent’s neighborhood diner.

    Soon after, he made his way to Dallas to attend college, but found his desire to cook too great to ignore and began working in local restaurants. In 2012, he was selected as the Chef de Cuisine at FT33 in Dallas, opening the restaurant under chef Matt McCallister and garnering numerous local and national awards. He then moved to Brooklyn, where he worked under chef Carlo Mirarchi as the Executive Sous Chef at Roberta’s and the two-Michelin-starred Blanca. In 2015, Brady joined Canlis as its sixth ever Executive Chef.
