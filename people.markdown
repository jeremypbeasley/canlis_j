  bio: The second of three sons, Mark grew up in a restaurant family. He joined Canlis
    in 2003, after graduating from Cornell University and serving as a Captain in
    Air Force Special Operations. He met his wife, Anne Marie, while opening famed
    restaurateur Danny Meyer’s fifth restaurant, Blue Smoke, in Manhattan. Returning
    to Seattle, Mark spearheaded the generational transfer and brand modernization
    that has garnered the family business national acclaim as one of the finest restaurants
    in America. He now owns and operates Canlis restaurant with his more talented
    brother, Brian (who edits this website). He and Anne Marie reside on Queen Anne

    to find his first job in the kitchen – working at his grandparent’s neighborhood
    diner. In 2012, he was selected as the Chef de Cuisine at FT33 in Dallas, opening
    the restaurant under chef Matt McCallister, before moving to Brooklyn, where he
    worked under chef Carlo Mirarchi as the Executive Sous Chef at Roberta’s and the
    two-Michelin-starred Blanca.<Br><Br>In 2015, Brady joined Canlis as its sixth-ever
    Executive Chef. Since then, he has garnered a number of local and national awards,
    including a perfect, 4-star review from the Seattle Times. He was also named a
    Finalist for Rising Star Chef of the Year by the James Beard Foundation for 2017,
    recognizing him as one of the country''s top, young culinary talents. In 2018,
    Brady was named as one of Food & Wine''s Best New Chefs, and in 2019, took home
    a James Beard Award for Best Chef: Northwest.'
- name: 'Crystal '
  title: Pastry Chef
  photo: "/uploads/crsytal.jpg"
  bio: "A native Texan and daughter of Taiwanese immigrant parents, Crystal grew up
    unaware of her kitchen talents and pursued communications at the University of
    Texas at Austin. Upon graduation, she relocated to Washington, D.C., where she
    became Press and Advance Advisor in the Office of Speaker Nancy Pelosi during
    her first speakership in the United States House of Representatives. After the
    political tides changed in 2011, Crystal also shifted gears and started a career
    in pastry.\n\nFollowing her studies at the French Pastry School in Chicago, she
    was brought on as pastry cook at Restaurant Daniel in New York City. After cementing
    her foundation in classic technique, Crystal sought to expand her culinary education
    and, for one year, staged across the Asia Pacific and its most notable restaurants,
    such as Room4Dessert in Indonesia, Narisawa in Japan, and Brae in Australia. In
    2016, she returned to Bali to become the Chef de Cuisine under Pastry Chef Will
    Goldfarb at Room4Dessert. While in Indonesia, Crystal created a food discovery
    enterprise named Asli Food Project, where she embedded herself in villages across
    the archipelago to gain a deeper understanding of culinary traditions and ingredients.\n\nCrystal
    joined Canlis as Pastry Chef in 2019, a role in which she will continue to seek
    a greater knowledge of the food we eat, not only for herself, but for the restaurant
    and its patrons. "

  bio: "Originally a native of Hawaii, Canlis Wine and Spirits Director Nelson Daquip
    left Alan Wong’s in Honolulu and joined Canlis in 2002. A quick study, Nelson
    became the most rapidly promoted employee in Canlis’ history, rising from server
    assistant to wine director in only four years. In 2006, Wine & Spirits Magazine
    named Nelson one of the “Best New Sommeliers” of the year, and in 2008 Seattle
    Magazine recognized him as the City’s Best Sommelier.\n\nToday, he is distinguished
    as an Advanced Sommelier with the Court of Master Sommeliers and under his leadership,
    Canlis has won ten consecutive Grand Awards from Wine Spectator Magazine. \n\nNelson
    not only brings the legacy of an aloha spirit to the table, but a drive to make
    Canlis one of the best wine and spirits programs in the world. Or, as Queen Lililuokalani
    stated in her last message to the people of Hawaii, “Kulia I ka Nu’u” —strive
    for the highest.\n"

  bio: A native of Colorado, Kyle moved to Germany as a Rotary International exchange
    student at the age of 16 before attaining degrees in Economics and International
    Relations at Seattle Pacific University. His first professional move took him
    to India, working in micro finance. In 2010 Kyle joined the team at Canlis as
    a newcomer to the industry. Within four years, and having worked every position
    in the dining room, he became the youngest Service Director in the restaurant’s
    history. And why not? He’s succeeded in creating the warmest hospitality experience
    in fine dining—a task he hardly considers to be work at all.
