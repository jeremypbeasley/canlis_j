  bio: |-
    The second of three sons, Mark grew up in a restaurant family. He joined Canlis in 2003, after graduating from Cornell University and serving as a Captain in Air Force Special Operations. He met his wife, Anne Marie, while opening famed restaurateur Danny Meyer’s fifth restaurant, Blue Smoke, in Manhattan. Returning to Seattle, Mark spearheaded the generational transfer and brand modernization that has garnered the family business national acclaim as one of the finest restaurants in America. He now owns and operates Canlis restaurant with his more talented brother, Brian (who edits this website).

    He and Anne Marie reside on Queen Anne with their three children.

  name: Brian Canlis
  title: Owner

  bio: Brian Canlis returned home to Seattle in 2005 after 12 years of studying and
    working abroad. For college he spent time in England, Austria, and Spain before
    finishing a hotel sciences degree at Cornell University. Commissioned as an Air
    Force officer in 2001, he led Elmendorf Air Force base in winning the coveted
    Hennessy Award (for the Air Force’s best food and dining experience). Just prior
    to his promotion to Captain, Brian was transferred to Washington D.C. to help
    lead a protocol team that played host to world leaders and international heads
    of state. (There’s a good chance you saw him saluting the President on CNN.) Brian
    is also an accomplished photographer, a role he plays both for Canlis and in his
    spare time. He is married to fellow photographer [Mackenzie Canlis](http://www.mackenziecanlis.com/)
    and isn’t nearly as talented as she is, but she loves him anyway. Their daughter,
    Marlow, was born in March 2016.
person3:
  name: Brady Williams
  title: Executive Chef

  bio: |-
    Born in Southern California and raised throughout different parts of the country, Brady fell in love with hockey at a young age. At the age of fifteen he moved away from home to pursue a promising professional career in the sport. After an injury ended his playing days, he moved home and started his first job – working at his grandparent’s neighborhood diner.

    In 2012, he was selected as the Chef de Cuisine at FT33 in Dallas, opening the restaurant under chef Matt McCallister and garnering numerous local and national awards. He then moved to Brooklyn, where he worked under chef Carlo Mirarchi as the Executive Sous Chef at Roberta’s and the two-Michelin-starred Blanca. In 2015, Brady joined Canlis as its sixth-ever Executive Chef. Two years later he was recognized by the James Beard Foundation as one of the country’s five hottest rising star chefs.
person4:
  name: Kyle Johnson
  title: Director of Service
  photo: "/uploads/portrait_kyle.jpg"
  bio: A native of Colorado, Kyle moved to Germany as a Rotary International exchange
    student at the age of 16 before attaining degrees in Economics and International
    Relations at Seattle Pacific University. His first professional move took him
    to India, working in micro finance. In 2010 Kyle joined the team at Canlis as
    a newcomer to the industry. Within four years, and having worked every position
    in the dining room, he became the youngest Service Director in the restaurant’s
    history. And why not? He’s succeeded in creating the warmest hospitality experience
    in fine dining—a task he hardly considers to be work at all.
person5:
  name: Nelson Daquip
  title: Director of Wine & Spirits
  photo: "/uploads/portrait_nelson.jpg"
  bio: "Originally a native of Hawaii, Canlis Wine and Spirits Director Nelson Daquip
    left Alan Wong’s in Honolulu and joined Canlis in 2002. A quick study, Nelson
    became the most rapidly promoted employee in Canlis’ history, rising from server
    assistant to wine director in only four years. In 2006, Wine & Spirits Magazine
    named Nelson one of the “Best New Sommeliers” of the year, and in 2008 Seattle
    Magazine recognized him as the City’s Best Sommelier.\n\nToday, he is distinguished
    as an Advanced Sommelier with the Court of Master Sommeliers and under his leadership,
    Canlis has won ten consecutive Grand Awards from Wine Spectator Magazine. \n\nNelson
    not only brings the legacy of an aloha spirit to the table, but a drive to make
    Canlis one of the best wine and spirits programs in the world. Or, as Queen Lililuokalani
    stated in her last message to the people of Hawaii, “Kulia I ka Nu’u” —strive
    for the highest.\n"
person6:
  name: Katie Coffman
  title: Director of Operations
  photo: "/uploads/Brian_gritty_2.jpg"
  bio: Katie Coffman joins Canlis after planning events for the Lynnwood Convention
    Center for nearly four years. Before this, she spent ten years in Stage Management.
    After graduating from Centenary College of Louisiana with a BS in Theater and
    Mathematics, she worked in London before settling in Seattle. Now she can't leave
    the mountains and water. In her spare time, she enjoys hiking, theater, and vegetarian
    cooking.
