    Canlis became a world-class wine destination in 1997, the first year of its twenty consecutive Wine Spectator Magazine Grand Awards. The restaurant is one several dozen to be trusted with such an honor for so long. In that time it has helped train 4 Master Sommeliers and 16 advanced sommeliers, collaborated to produce wines with Alois Kracher, Buty, Jean Milan, Hirsch, Berescht & Fils and played routinely hosts the best wine makers in the world for dinner (LaTour, Grace Family, Alan Shoupe, pio cezare, the Marchezzi Pierro Antinori, Angelo Gaja, Heredia Lopez) Which is all, very fancy. What distinguishes the Canlis wine program and the sommeliers who run it is their singular ability to relate to other people, particularly those who just like to enjoy a bottle with life, and then move on.

    Our program is founded on a team of educated wine professionals, the highest quality amenities, and the warm and reputable service for which Canlis is famous. There is also one very juicy wine list. We look forward to sharing the world of wine with you.
