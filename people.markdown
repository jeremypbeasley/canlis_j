  bio: The second of three sons, Mark grew up in a restaurant family. He joined Canlis
    in 2003, after graduating from Cornell University and serving as a Captain in
    Air Force Special Operations. He met his wife, Anne Marie, while opening famed
    restaurateur Danny Meyer’s fifth restaurant, Blue Smoke, in Manhattan. Returning
    to Seattle, Mark spearheaded the generational transfer and brand modernization
    that has garnered the family business national acclaim as one of the finest restaurants
    in America. He now owns and operates Canlis restaurant with his more talented
    brother, Brian (who edits this website). He and Anne Marie reside on Queen Anne
