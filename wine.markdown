  Canlis became a world-class wine destination in 1997, the first year of its 28 consecutive Wine Spectator Magazine Grand Awards. The restaurant is one of a handful in the world to be trusted with the honor for that length of time. In 2017, our wine program took home the James Beard award for <a href="https://seattle.eater.com/2017/5/2/15517450/james-beard-award-2017-canlis-wine" target="_blank">Outstanding Wine Program</a>. Since then, it has helped train four Master Sommeliers and nine advanced sommeliers. We’ve produced wines with Alois Kracher, Buty, Jean Milan, Hirsch, and Guiborat & Fils. We’ve routinely played hosts to the best winemakers and wineries in the world, like Château Latour, Grace Family, Penfolds, Cayuse, Piero Antinori, Angelo Gaja and Maria López de Heredia.

  While this is all quite fancy, what distinguishes the Canlis wine program and the sommeliers who run it is their singular ability to relate to other people, particularly those who just like to enjoy a bottle with dinner, and then move on.
wine_body_col2: "The wine program at Canlis is founded on a team of educated wine
  professionals, the highest quality amenities, and the warm and reputable service
  for which Canlis is famous. There is also one very juicy wine list. We look forward
  to sharing the world of wine with you. \n\nWe invite you to download the list and
  enjoy a good read, or skip it all together and let us do the work of finding the
  right wine for your evening\n\nCorkage Policy: We're happy to open two 750ml bottles
  per reservation, for $50 per bottle. We ask that the bottles not be on our list. "

  In 1949, Seattle lifted its ban on restaurants offering liquor and issued Canlis the first license to sell.  With a live piano nightly and the best barman in town, a new era of the cocktail was born. Since then, as far as we’re concerned, it’s only gotten better.

  Walk-ins welcome.
