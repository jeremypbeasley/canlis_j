<p class="mb0 pb0">We made a book —just for our staff. </p>

<p class="mb0 pb0">It's all about who we are, what we believe about hospitality, and the stories that made us. In typical fashion, we went all out: spending five years writing, photographing, unarchiving, and designing something we're proud to give to our people.</p>

<p class="mb0 pb0">We’ve decided to sell select copies of this book outside the restaurant to raise money for our friends at Vision House.</p>

<p class="mb0 pb0">We're asking $500 for each book. Come back to this link at Noon PST on Wednesday to purchase the book. </p>
