    <p class="Caption mb2">Working at Canlis</p>
    <p>We’re honored you are interested in joining our team. To help that process, we recommend you read most of this entire website to figure out what makes us tick. We recommend thinking about how working here will help you become more of who you want to become, not what you want to become. We recommend taking the advice of your mother — whatever it was she said, try to remember — it’s going to help you get a job here.<p>

    <p class="Caption mb2">Philosophy Matters</p>
    <p class="mb7 d-mb5">The only way we can continue to develop the Canlis experience in a way that fits with our mission and values is to invest in our people. We hire learners and we are learners ourselves. Canlis is a place where employees are nurtured and grown. Only then can they truly serve. Additionally, there is a particular humility inherent in learning. We want you to have this...or at least to desperately want to have this. It is a requirement for employment.</p>
    <p class="Caption mb2">Benefits</p>
    <p class="mb3">Medical, dental, vision, 401k, profit sharing, staff meals, dining privileges, employee educational scholarships, superb team environment, closed Sundays and major holidays...oh, and we'll never serve brunch.</p>
