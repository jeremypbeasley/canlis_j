  bio: |-
    The person now formerly known as Cayley Madison Boire, grew up in upstate New York, Canada where she spent her free time looking at snow. She joined the Canlis management team after graduating from the Cornell School of Hotel Administration in the summer of 2017. She immediately left on a 6 month vacation to the most prestigious wine regions in the world. After returning from her sabbatical, she proceeded to crush the dining room floor as Cayley Canlis. She has since been adopted by Mark Canlis and renounces any previous affiliations.

    In her free time, Cayley likes to drink wine while thinking about her college debt.

  bio: |-
    JR grew up in dangerous streets of Spokane, Washington. Four months before dropping out of college, he moved to Tacoma where we continued his path of directionless soul searching . With virtually no purpose, he bounced around from small town to small town before finding his calling at Canlis. He started as the expeditor-in-training, a time that he calls the highlight of his career. After mastering the art of yelling at kitchen servers, JR has advanced to low level management and subsequently changed his name back to Jeff. In his free time he watches his two children while consuming oranges to fight off the dangers of scurvy.

    Jeff has won the coveted Mr. TGO award. He did not receive a cash prize for his efforts.

  bio: |-
    A native of Reno, Nevada, Maren spent most of her childhood holding beating fish hearts on her parentâ€™s boat, The Samaqu. She learned how to walk onboard a ship and  has never developed her land legs. Watch out.

    After leaving home, she attended college in Vermont where she majored in drama. During this time she consumed her weight in maple syrup, but luckily did not develop diabetes. Maren returned home in 2010 and found her new home at Canlis. She started as a kitchen runner and proceeded to strong hand her way up to private dining coordinator. Since joining the private dining team she has single handedly saved the restaurant from going under.

    In her free time, Maren brainstorms different ways to terrify new kitchen runners.
person5:
  name: Amy Wong
  title: Reservations Manager

  bio: |-
    Amy grew up in the land of Atlanta where she learned how to dance and fold dumplings at the same time. She attended Georgia Southern University where she decided that she did not need a college degree to answer phones. To this day, that has remained the best decision that she has made in her life.
    Shortly after dropping out, she left to NYC where she tried to be an adult for a few years before leaving to reside in Dallas and Las Vegas for a short time. In that period she learned how to play poker and con men out of their spending money. She has since retired from the dark life of underground poker, but is tempted every now and then.
    In her free time, she answers emails and makes reservations for executive chef, Brady Williams.
