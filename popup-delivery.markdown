title: 'Popup Card: Delivery'
body: "Canlis servers, our delivery drivers, will arrive within one hour of the time you have chosen. For example, if you selected a 5pm meal we’ll arrive sometime between 5pm and 6pm. So you can plan ahead and to minimize contact, we’ll send you a text as soon as we are en route and again when we arrive at your address. <br><br> If you live in an apartment building, we ask that you come outside to pick up your order. For everyone's safety, our servers will not enter buildings. Wine or alcohol orders require ID check."
