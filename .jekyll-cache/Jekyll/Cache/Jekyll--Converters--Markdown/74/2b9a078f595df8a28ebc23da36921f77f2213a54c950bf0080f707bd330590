I"<p>It might be different here from the last place you worked. Canlis is a place where employees are nurtured and grown. The standards here aren’t any lower and the job is not any easier. We just don’t compromise one another for the sake of getting our work done. It’s not cool, and it turns out to be super counterproductive. We hire learners and we are learners ourselves. There is a humility inherent to this approach and we want you to have this…or at least to desperately want to have this. It is a requirement for employment.</p>
