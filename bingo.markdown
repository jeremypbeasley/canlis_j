<p class="Captionm mb2">How to play</p>

1. Tune in on April 17th at 8:30PM for two live-hosted rounds.

2. Random numbers are drawn and whoever completed a bingo pattern first, wins the prize. A winning bingo pattern is a line with five numbers in a diagonal, horizontal, or vertical row. Numbers must be X'd out with a pen.

3. Text us a photo of your winning bingo card (and the Canlis Family Meal stamp on the back) as fast as you can. (408) 702-1978

The first person to text their winning card will receive a Canlis CSA box, a $100 Canlis Gift Card, and 2 rolls of double-ply premium Canlis toilet paper, delivered to your door.
