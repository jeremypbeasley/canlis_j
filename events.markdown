  capacity: 2 - 4 guests
  desc: "A heightened Canlis dining experience. Dinner begins in a private room upstairs,
    originally built as the owner's office, with spectacular views of Lake Union &
    the Cascade Mountains. Price includes a round of savory snacks, Grand Cru Champagne,
    and our four-course dining experience. After dinner, enjoy Cognac and a behind-the-scenes
    tour of the restaurant to include our wine cellar and perhaps a secret or two
    . Additional beverages are not included. 21+ only. Due to the specific timing
    of these experiences, we will alter the evening as necessary in response to late
    reservations. Guests dining at the 5:30 seating may expect dinner to transition
    to the tour just before 8:30pm.\n\nPrepaid reservations for 2-4. \n$300 per person"
