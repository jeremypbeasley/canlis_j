  title: Working at Canlis
  desc: |-
    We’re honored you are interested in joining our team. To help that process, we recommend you read most of this entire website to figure out what makes us tick. We recommend thinking about how working here will help you become more of who you want to become, not what you want to become. We recommend taking the advice of your mother — whatever it was she said, try to remember — it’s going to help you get a job here.

    To apply, please send a resume and cover letter to Andy Pelander at [work@canlis.com](mailto:work@canlis.com).

    Roles we are currently hiring for:<br>
    Line Cooks / Pay Range: $22-$26/hour<br>
    Dining Room Service Team / Pay Range: $22-$50/hour<br>
    Pastry Cooks / Pay Range: $22-$26/hour<br>
section2:
  title: You Matter
  desc: It might be different here from the last place you worked. Canlis is a place
    where employees are nurtured and grown. The standards here aren’t any lower and
    the job is not any easier. We just don't compromise one another for the sake of
    getting our work done. It’s not cool, and it turns out to be super counterproductive.
    We hire learners and we are learners ourselves. There is a humility inherent to
    this approach and we want you to have this…or at least to desperately want to
    have this. It is a requirement for employment.
