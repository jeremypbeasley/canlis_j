<div class="Caption mb4 mt4">Food Allergies</div>

<p class="mb2 pb0">At Canlis, we understand and respect the importance of accommodating guests with food allergies or intolerances. While we take every precaution to honor dietary requirements and minimize the risk of cross-contact, we must inform you that our kitchen handles a wide variety of ingredients and despite our best efforts, we cannot guarantee that cross-contact with allergens has not occurred in our kitchen or before the ingredients arrived in our kitchen. We encourage guests with severe food allergies to exercise their discretion and inform our staff of their dietary needs. Our team will gladly provide information about the ingredients used in our dishes and offer alternative options whenever possible.</p>

<p class="mb2 pb0"> With this in mind, please be aware that consuming our food is done at your own risk, and Canlis cannot be held liable for any adverse reactions that may occur. The well-being of our staff and guests remains our highest priority–thank you for helping us do this well.</p>

<div class="Caption mb4 mt4">Specific Dietary Requests</div>

<p class="mb2 pb0">We are pleased to offer modifications for vegetarian, vegan, dairy-free, and gluten-free diets. Please note, however, that alliums, salt, sugar, and vinegar are integral to our menu and cannot be removed. Requests to avoid these ingredients may result in the omission of certain courses.</p>

<p class="Caption mt4">Attire</p>

<p class="mb0 pb0">We’re a very dressy restaurant. We recommend a suit or sport coat for men, and ask that no T-shirts, shorts, hats, or casual attire of any kind be worn. At Canlis you can’t be overdressed, so go big, look good and have fun with it!</p>

<div class="Caption mb4 mt4">Children</div>
<p class="mb0 pb0">All ages are welcome in our dining room but we ask that children be prepared for a lengthy dining experience. We do not allow tablets or phones to entertain children at the table and we will request devices used in this manner to be turned off. Dining as a family is a part of the fabric of this place, but it is an art best practiced long before your reservation. For the communal sake of our dining room please choose wisely. </p>

<div class="Caption mb4 mt4">Cancellations</div>
<p class="mb0 pb0">If you need to cancel a reservation for any reason you may do so forty-eight hours in advance and we will issue a full refund of your deposit. The reservation becomes non-refundable two days prior to your booking. Reservations changing to a smaller party size do not receive a refunded deposit. To recoup the deposit for a reservation decreasing in size you may cancel the reservation outside the 48-hour window and rebook a smaller table if one is available. We cannot make exceptions for COVID-19 diagnoses.  </p>
