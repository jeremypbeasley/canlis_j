I"J<p>Canlis became a world-class wine destination in 1997, the first year of its 24 consecutive Wine Spectator Magazine Grand Awards. The restaurant is one of a handful in the world to be trusted with the honor for that length of time. In 2017, our wine program, led by former Wine Director, Nelson Daquip, took home the James Beard award for <a href="https://seattle.eater.com/2017/5/2/15517450/james-beard-award-2017-canlis-wine" target="_blank">Outstanding Wine Program</a>. Since then, it has helped train four Master Sommeliers and nine advanced sommeliers. We’ve produced wines with Alois Kracher, Buty, Jean Milan, Hirsch, and Guiborat &amp; Fils. We’ve routinely played hosts to the best winemakers and wineries in the world, like Château Latour, Grace Family, Penfolds, Cayuse, Piero Antinori, Angelo Gaja and Maria López de Heredia.</p>

<p>While this is all quite fancy, what distinguishes the Canlis wine program and the sommeliers who run it is their singular ability to relate to other people, particularly those who just like to enjoy a bottle with dinner, and then move on.</p>
