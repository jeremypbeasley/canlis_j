Canlis will not air Friday Night Bingo tomorrow. Instead a time of fundraising and civic self-reflection with SYML as he performs live Friday from 8-9PM PST.

An anti-racism benefit and time of self-reflection, we invite you to join us in supporting two organizations we deeply believe in: M.U.S.T and Social Justice Fund Northwest. Canlis will match all funds donated during the hour-long program up to $10,000.

These difficult times shall pass, but if we have anything to do with it, not until our hearts have changed and our actions cement a new way forward.

We hope youâ€™ll join us here.
