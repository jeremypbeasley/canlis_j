<i>About The Guests</i>

Sharon Irving is a native of Chicago, born and raised on the South Side of Chicago, Sharon's musical education started early. Her father, Robert Irving III, a jazz musician and musical director for Miles Davis, frequently brought her to the studio with him. As a student at North Park University, she realized that she wanted to be a "voice for the voiceless" through song and spoken word. Sharon continues to pursue this artistic journey by working on her first album, a collection of song, poetry and rap. She loves exploring different genres, covering everyone from Dolly Parton to Billie Holiday to one of her biggest inspirations, Lauryn Hill. She hopes her music will inspire each and every person watching America's Got Talent to find and use their unique voice.

A native of Chicago, Robert Irving III was one of a group of young Chicago musicians that in the late '70s and early '80s formed the nucleus of Miles Davis' recording and touring bands. Irving left the Davis band in 1989, and has gone on to a prolific career as touring musician, composer, arranger, producer, educator and interdisciplinary artist. Irving resumed his career as a recording artist under his own name with the 2007 release of New Momentum and more recently with the release of "Our Space In Time" by Robert Irving III Generations (featuring students Irving mentored through the Jazz Institute of Chicago Jazz Links program).
