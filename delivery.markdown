All orders must be placed by 8PM the day before your delivery.

<h2 class="Caption mt2 mb3">Delivery Zone</h2>

Available to any address inside Seattle city limits, Shoreline, Mercer Island, Bellevue (West of 405). Unfortunately, we cannot deliver to West Seattle, due to the bridge closure. If your address falls outside of this zone, you are welcome to pick up your order at the restaurant. Please note that information in the delivery notes.
