  title: Working at Canlis
  desc: |-
    We’re honored you are interested in joining our team. To help that process, we recommend you read most of this entire website to figure out what makes us tick. We recommend thinking about how working here will help you become more of who you want to become, not what you want to become. We recommend taking the advice of your mother — whatever it was she said, try to remember — it’s going to help you get a job here.

    To apply, please send a resume and cover letter to Anthea Gundersen at [work@canlis.com](mailto:work@canlis.com).

    Roles we are currently hiring for:<br>
    Line Cooks<br>
    AM Prep Cooks<br>
    Private Event Cooks<br>
    Pastry Cooks <br>
    Dishwashers<br>
    Dining Room Service Team
section2:
  title: You Matter
  desc: It might be different here from the last place you worked. Canlis is a place
    where employees are nurtured and grown. The standards here aren’t any lower and
    the job is not any easier. We just don't compromise one another for the sake of
    getting our work done. It’s not cool, and it turns out to be super counterproductive.
    We hire learners and we are learners ourselves. There is a humility inherent to
    this approach and we want you to have this…or at least to desperately want to
    have this. It is a requirement for employment.
section3:
  title: Pay & Benefits
  desc: Pay starts at a minimum of $21/hr. We offer medical/dental/vision healthcare
    (cost covered 50% by employer, 75% after one year, 100% for all salary employees)
    and a really legit 401k and profit sharing program. We eat like royalty, don’t
    work Sundays, Mondays, or major holidays, and celebrate taking time off. Oh, and
    we’ll never serve brunch.
section4:
  title: Our Mission
  desc: To inspire all people to turn toward one another.
section5:
  title: Our Vision
  desc: 'The Vision is our strategy to successfully accomplish the mission: We are

    growing personally, emotionally, relationally, and professionally. We serve one
    another and our guests in a way that makes people feel valued and restored.'
